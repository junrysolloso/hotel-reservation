                    1.1 Accommodation Services
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Accommodation may be offered separately or as part of a package holiday or Flight-Plus. The Services are subject to the Rules and Restrictions of the Suppliers offering the accommodation which will be made available before booking. The Rules and Restrictions may include restrictions on and/or charges for cancellation and/or changes imposed by the Suppliers.
                    <br>
                    Subject to section 3.2.6 and 3.2.7., any pre-paid "pay online now" hotel bookings and Expedia Unpublished Rate hotel bookings will require that a Customer's credit card is charged for the full payment upon reservation. Other hotel bookings will require bank card or credit card details to secure the reservation and final payment will be settled directly with the hotel during the stay. Please refer to the details shown during the reservation process to confirm how and when payment will be made. Prices shown on the Website do not include any fees or charges for optional supplements, including minibar snacks or telephone calls.
                    <br>
                    If a Customer does not show for the first night of the reservation and plans to check-in for subsequent nights in the reservation, the Customer must confirm the reservation changes with Expedia no later than the original date of check-in to prevent cancellation of the whole reservation. If the Customer does not confirm the reservation changes with Expedia the whole reservation may be cancelled and refunds will only be due to the Customer in line with the Rules and Restrictions of the applicable Supplier as notified in the booking process.<br>
                    Any Customer who does not cancel or change their reservation before the cancellation policy period applicable to the hotel which varies by hotel (usually 24 to 72 hours) prior to the date of arrival will be subject to the charges shown in the Rules and Restrictions for the hotel reservation. Customers should note that some hotels do not permit changes to or cancellations of reservations after they are made and these restrictions are shown in the Rules and Restrictions for the hotel reservation.
                    <br>
                    You may not book more than 8 rooms online for the same hotel/stay dates. If we determine that you have booked more than 8 rooms in total in separate reservations, we may cancel your reservations, and charge you a cancellation fee, if applicable. If you paid a non-refundable deposit, your deposit will be forfeited. If you wish to book 9 or more rooms, you must complete the group travel form online. One of our group travel specialists will research your request and contact you to complete your reservation. You may be asked to sign a written contract and/or pay a non-refundable deposit if required by the hotel.

                    1.2 Use of rooms
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Customer is reminded that, in general, rooms are only available from 14:00 and have to be vacated by 12:00, irrespective of the time of arrival or departure or the means of transport used.
                    <br>
                    Single rooms generally have one bed and a supplement is often payable for these rooms. Double rooms usually have either two single beds or one double bed.

                    1.3 Classification
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The indication of the comfort level given to hotels in the descriptions on the Website corresponds to a classification based on local standards in that country, which can differ from standards in United Kingdom. This classification is provided only as an indication. Customers should be aware that standards can vary between hotels of the same class in different countries, and even in the same country. It is important to read carefully the individual hotel descriptions. Accommodation in all hotels, whatever the rating, is in standard rooms unless otherwise stated.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1. Single: These have the lowest prices. The accommodation meets the minimum requirements for facilities and is in general clean and simple. Bathroom facilities are typically shared.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2. Double: Simple accommodation with a little more attention to style and ambiance, yet still for a low price. The facilities and the service are limited. A certain number of public rooms, a shop or, for example, a caf√© could be included.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    4. Deluxe: First-class accommodation for the more demanding guest. Attention has been paid to luxury, hospitality and service. A top-quality restaurant and a wealth of facilities can be expected at these reliable hotels. First-class accommodation for business travellers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is possible that, from time to time, for reasons (for example a hotel is overbooked due to connectivity issues with the hotel) for reasons of force majeure (for example a hotel is closed due to a hurricane) a hotel booking is cancelled or amended. Should such events occur, Expedia will make all reasonable efforts to notify the Customer of this as soon as possible and where possible will offer alternative accommodation in a hotel in at least the same star classification with similar services. If this offer is not taken by the Customer, Expedia will ensure that all monies paid in respect of the hotel booking are refunded. If appropriate, for example where a technical issue on the part of Expedia has caused a booking to be cancelled or amended and such cancellation or amendment directly causes loss to the Customer, Expedia will also pay reasonable compensation to the Customer.
